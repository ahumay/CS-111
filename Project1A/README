To use non-canonical input mode with no echo, I used this reference at my TA's advice:
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Noncanon-Example.html

POLL
1. we have one pollfd for stdin, one for stdout
2. pollin
pollup/pollerr
3. loop with poll(2)/timeout read only if input
4. in case of shutdown process an input before shutdown
To get familiar with poll, I looked at:
https://linux.die.net/man/2/poll

To understand how to pass input/output from terminal to shell for the 3rd part, I looked 
at pipes and how they are used:
http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~cs315/Spring10/labs/lab02/pipes.pdf
Figure 5 is a great figure for what we are trying to do, just with child and parent
processes instead of parent and client.

To get more familiar with Termios I looked at:
https://blog.nelhage.com/2009/12/a-brief-introduction-to-termios-termios3-and-stty/

For processing the arguments, like in Lab 0, I loosely based it off of
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt-Long-Option-Example.html

Makefile
---
This Makefile was much simpler than Lab 0's. 
For default, clean, and dist, I just implemented the core functionality of each command. 
I added .SILENT underneath default so that if there were errors or warnings during compilation,
it would still show.
