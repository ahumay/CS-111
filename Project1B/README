The files included are:
lab1b-client.c
---
Mostly a combination of what we were instructed to do in 
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/os98/Pgms/client.c 
and Lab 1A.

lab1b-serve.c
---
Mostly a combination of what we were instructed to do in 
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/os98/Pgms/server.c
and Lab 1A.

Makefile
---
This Makefile was much simpler than Lab 0's. 
For default, clean, and dist, I just implemented the core functionality of each command. 
I added .SILENT underneath default so that if there were errors or warnings during compilation,
it would still show.  

my.key
---
My key for encryption, I just typed in random letters from my keyboard.
