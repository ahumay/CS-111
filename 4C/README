The files included are:
lab4c_tls.c
---
This file communicates with the logging server.
Opens a TCP connection to a specific server, gives
it a unique ID to track the local device. The device then sends
the temperature data over the connection. 
The server can stop receiving this data with an OFF command.

lab4c_tcp.c
---
This file opens a TLS session. 
Sends student ID, temperature data over the connection, 
now with the TLS encryption.


Makefile
---
For default, clean, and dist, I just implemented the core functionality of each command. 
I added .SILENT underneath default so that if there were errors or warnings during compilation,
it would still show.  
It includes: 
default - build program.
clean - remove old files.
dist - for the tarball.
