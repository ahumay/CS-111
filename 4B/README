The files included are:
lab4b.c
---
Implemented the temperature taking functionality of the lab, 
and prints out / logs all the temperatures into a file. 
One can adjust the time between taking temperatures, as well 
as whether it is returned in Fahrenheit or Celsius. 
A user can also type one of the following commands:
SCALE=F
SCALE=C
PERIOD=seconds
STOP
START
LOG line of text
OFF
All of these pieces of information are put into the lab report. 


Makefile
---
For default, clean, and dist, I just implemented the core functionality of each command. 
I added .SILENT underneath default so that if there were errors or warnings during compilation,
it would still show.  
It includes: 
default - build program.
check - run smoketest.
clean - remove old files.
dist - for the tarball.
